Caesar Cypher
=============

A code for applying a caesar cypher to strings. 

A caesar cypher will take a sentence and shift every letter along the alphabet. For example: "A" cyphered with a shift of 2 will be "C"; "Hi with a shift of 3 will be "Kl"

This repository is my solution for the Caeasar Cypher project assignment in the curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/caesar-cipher "The Odin Project").
